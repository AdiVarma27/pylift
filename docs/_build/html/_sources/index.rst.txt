Welcome to pylift's documentation!
==================================

**pylift** is an uplift library that provides, primarily, (1) fast uplift modeling implementations and (2) evaluation tools. While other packages and more exact methods exist to model uplift, **pylift** is designed to be quick, flexible, and effective. **pylift** heavily leverages the optimizations of other packages -- namely, `xgboost`, `sklearn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `scipy`.
