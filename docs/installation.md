# Installation
At the moment, the package must be built from source. This means cloning the repo and installing, using the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/wayfair/pylift
cd pylift
pip install .
```

To upgrade, `git pull origin master` in the repo folder, and
then run `pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir .`.
