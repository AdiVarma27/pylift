[Read our documentation!](https://pylift.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

**pylift** is an uplift library that provides, primarily:

1. Fast uplift modeling implementations. 
2. Evaluation tools \(`UpliftEval` class\).

While other packages and more exact methods exist to model uplift, **pylift** is designed to be quick, flexible, and effective. **pylift** heavily leverages the optimizations of other packages -- namely, `xgboost`, `sklearn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `scipy`. The primary method currently implemented is the Transformed Outcome proxy method \(Athey 2015\).

This branch is a fork from [github.com/wayfair/pylift](https://github.com/wayfair/pylift), and is actively being maintained.
